# Tableau-Final-Project
After we had a general overview of this dataset regarding to profit, we thought it was more meaningful to figure out the most profitable movie genre, director and actor. Therefore, we grouped our dataset into three different subsets in which budget is low, medium and high. Therefore, we can use filters to dynamically show the most profitable actresses, directors, and movie type by different budget levels.

To make a profitable and high-IMDB score movie, we need to consider the following five aspects: genre, director, actor, budget and country. And we take the data from year 1990 to year 2016 to do our analysis.

Data preparation
We split the genre column into “genres-main type” column with only the first genre of the movie and “genres-others”, which contains the rest part of the genre.
### Genre
This is a graph showing the average profit trend of top 10 genres (genres-main type) with the high average profitability. 
### Country
Next, we used geographic data to plot the profitability of movies by country.




Finally, we used correlation analysis to identify relationships between different continuous variables. We identified that a movie’s gross revenue has a strong positive relationship with Facebook likes.
